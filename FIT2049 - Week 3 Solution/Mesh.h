*	Created by Elliott Wilson & Mike Yeates - 2016 - Monash University
*	This class represents an indexed Mesh of 3D Vertices.
*	It is capable of loading triangulated OBJ files as well as creating simple primitives
*	It also manages a collection of loaded meshes so we can fetch them statically from any object
